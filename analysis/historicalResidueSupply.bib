  abstract = {The estimation of aboveground biomass density (organic dry mass per unit area) is required for balancing Canadian national forest carbon budgets. Tree biomass equations are the basic tool for converting inventory plot data into biomass density. New sets of national tree biomass equations have therefore been produced from archival biomass data collected at the beginning of the 1980s through the ENergy from the FORest research program (ENFOR) of the Canadian Forest Service. Since the sampling plan was not standardized among provinces and territories, data had to be harmonized before any biomass equation could be considered at the national level. Two features characterize the new equations: estimated biomass of the compartments (foliage, branch, wood, and bark) are constrained to equal the total biomass, and dependence among error terms for the considered compartments of the same tree is taken into account in the estimates of both the model parameters and the variance prediction. The estimation method known to economists as "seemingly unrelated regression" allowed the inclusion of dependencies among the error terms of the considered biomass compartments. Sets of equations based on diameter at breast height (dbh) and on dbh and height have been produced for 33 species, groups of hardwood and softwood, and for all species combined. Biomass predicted by the new equations was compared with that estimated from provincial equations to evaluate the loss of accuracy when scaling up from the regional to the national scale. Bias and error of prediction from the set of national equations based on dbh and height were generally more similar to those from provincial equations than to those of predictions from the set of equations based on dbh alone. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

  abstract  = {Cellulosic biorefineries require a stable supply of low-cost feedstock. In this paper we conduct a financial analysis of hybrid poplar as a purpose grown biofuel feedstock. We analyzed growth rates and costs for producing hybrid poplar in the Peace River region of western Canada – an area previously identified as a preferred location for a large biorefinery. We estimated financial returns for two hybrid poplar management systems: (i) a single-stem system that involves the planting and harvesting of individual trees according to optimal economic rotations of 20–26 years, and (ii) a coppice (multi-stem) system that involves multiple harvests of new shoots that sprout from stumps following harvest every 3–4 years. Results suggest that the coppice system is financially inferior (with estimated costs of 202 {\$} Mg−1) to the single-stem system (with estimated costs of 125 {\$} Mg−1), largely due to the cost of establishing the high density coppice plantations. But even the single-stem production system does not appear to be financially feasible given the current environment of high land prices and low biomass prices. In contrast to estimated costs of growing poplar, current biomass prices for agriculture and forestry residues are approximately 50 {\$} Mg−1. However, even though purpose grown energy crops are more expensive than residues, they could be valuable in supplementing a biorefinery's feedstock supply during years when residue yields are low. If governments in Canada wish to encourage renewable energy from cellulosic feedstock, then current economic conditions suggest that subsidies aimed at biomass production are likely required.},

abstract = {In recent decades, the Internet, together with information and communication technologies such as personal computers and cellular phones, has provided an electronic alternative to newspapers and printed materials. We examine how Internet adoption has affected worldwide demand for newsprint and printing and writing papers. We find that the Internet has reduced demand for newsprint in all regions. These regions include the United States, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries other than the United States, the countries of the former Soviet Union (Reform), the Asian countries not in the OECD (Asia), and developing countries in Africa and Latin America. The effect is strongest in the United States, where we predict that as of 2011 newsprint consumption would have been 4 times higher in the absence of the Internet. The effects on printing and writing papers are more varied. The Internet is found to have reduced consumption in the United States and OECD countries, had a negligible effect in Asia and the Reform region, and increased consumption in Africa and Latin America. By accounting for Internet adoption, our new demand estimates have the potential to improve forecasts of paper consumption contained in forest outlook studies.},

abstract = {Technological development has enabled the production of new value-added products from lignocellulosic residues such as lignin. This has allowed the forest industry to diversify its product portfolio and maximize the economic returns from feedstock, while simultaneously working towards sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based products. Although previous research has explored industrial-scale production opportunities, many challenges persist, including the cost of woody biomass and its supply chain reliability. While numerous studies have addressed these issues, their emphasis has traditionally been on bioenergy, with little focus on biochemical, biomaterials, and bioproducts. This review seeks to address this gap through a systematic study of the work recently reported by researchers. A lot of work has been published from United States and Canada with an emphasis on bioenergy production (84.8{\%}), 4.6{\%} of the work is focused on biomass to materials and chemicals, and 10.6{\%} addressed both. Between 2012 and 2015, the majority of published research focused on biomass to materials and chemicals and both biomass to energy and biomass to materials and chemicals. This fact highlights recent interests in diversified biorefinery portfolios. However, further work concerning forest biomass supply chain optimization and new high-value bio-based materials and chemicals is necessary.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive but concise review of the various quantitative methods, in particular, optimization techniques, for the efficient management and control of complex forest biomass supply chains. The review is structured around a top-down hierarchical planning approach that includes strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. At each planning level, the review presents and analyses the problem to be solved, the solution (optimization) methods, and the various aspects to take into consideration for the successful implementation and use of these methods by biomass supply chain planners. Recent Findings: Forest biomass constitutes one of the various sources of renewable energy with the potential to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. Fo rest biomass supply chains are systems with complex network designs consisting of many supply, demand, and intermediate points where the biomass is collected, stored, processed, and transported. The complexity of these supply chains as well as various factors impact the effective supply of forest-based biomass. For example, the biomass characteristics (e.g., energy content or quality), the variability in the market and economic conditions, and processing of the biomass are the main factors. The complexity requires a good understanding of the methods that exist to manage and optimize forest biomass supply chains. Summary: Although substantial research has been done around forest biomass supply chain management and optimization, future research should focus on developing integrated frameworks that allow the optimization of biomass supply chains at the strategic, tactical, and operational level. These studies should also explore and propose approaches for the successful implementation of the proposed optimization methods.},

  abstract  = {Forest biomass is one of the renewable and sustainable sources of energy that can be used for producing electricity, heat, and biofuels. The complex supply chain of forest biomass for energy generation, which consists of different players and products and is affected by biomass characteristics, such as low density and unpredictable quality, makes the energy generation cost from biomass higher than that of the conventional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. Moreover, variability and uncertainty in this supply chain, mainly due to the nature of material, economic condition and market fluctuation, affect the amount of produced energy and its cost. Mathematical modeling, in particular optimization techniques, can be employed to manage the supply chain and achieve the optimum design. This paper reviews studies which used deterministic and stochastic mathematical models to optimize forest biomass supply chains for electricity, heat and biofuels production. Optimization models were used to provide the optimum solution for decisions related to the network design, technology choice, plant size and location, storage location, mix of products and raw materials, logistics options, supply areas, and material flows. Mainly, economic objectives were considered in these models. Further studies should consider environmental and social objectives, in addition to the economic ones, in the models. In non-deterministic models uncertainty mainly in the demand, supply, prices, and conversion yields were incorporated. Although material quality is an important uncertain parameter in the forest biomass supply chain that affects the amount and cost of produced energy, its variation was not considered in previous studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Biomass logistics comprise of inter-dependent operations related to harvesting and collection, storage, pre-processing, and transportation. Its high cost represents one of the barriers in widespread use of biomass for energy and fuel production. Therefore, improving and optimizing biomass logistics are essential in overcoming this barrier. Biomass logistics was reviewed in a previous study that aimed at categorizing logistics operations, but the inherent issues and complexities, and how they were incorporated in mathematical models were not discussed in detail. The objective of this paper is to review the important features of biomass logistics operations, discuss how they were incorporated in mathematical optimization models, and explain the new trends in biomass logistics optimization. Differences between the models dealing with forest-based and agriculture-based biomass are highlighted. Important features incorporated in logistics models include demand-driven and supply-driven collection, collection of biomass in different forms, storage at intermediate facilities, biomass quality deterioration, inter-modal distribution for long-distance transportation, operational level transportation planning, and planning the pre-processing of biomass. Recent trends in biomass logistics models include the consideration of scattered availability of biomass across supply areas, uncertainties in biomass supply, integration with GIS, emissions from logistics operations, and traffic congestion due to biomass transportation. Most of the literature on biomass logistics focused on medium-term planning, while that for short-term planning is still in its infancy. The current biomass logistics models focused mainly on economic objectives, while environmental concerns related to emissions from logistics activities received limited attention. The trade-off between environmental and economic aspects of biomass logistics operations have not been investigated. Social aspects such as increase in traffic congestion due to biomass transportation received limited attention in the literature. Most of the previous models were tested on hypothetical cases, while developing suitable models to address practical issues in real case studies would be valuable.},

  abstract  = {Given the increasing risk of climate change and depletion of non-renewable energy sources, countries around the world have been looking into energy profile diversification whereby biomass represents one of the most appealing alternatives for energy production feedstock. To attract interest and more investment from industry players into biomass-based industries, comprehensive techno-economic analysis has to be performed. In addition, various uncertainties related to supply chain such as biomass attainability, demand variation, and material price fluctuation, have to be considered in the evaluation to yield more accurate and reliable feasibility estimation. This review paper aims to: (i) provide an overview on the different types of methods or approaches used in the feasibility evaluation of biomass-based industries from the techno-economic point of view, and (ii) outline the supply chain uncertainties that should be incorporated into the evaluation model using a Malaysian case study to illustrate the impact of these uncertainties. Apart from that, some of the unquantifiable uncertainties and risks are critically reviewed in this paper. It was found that 78 {\%} of the reviewed articles opted for mathematical modelling evaluation method with the majority leaning towards mathematical modelling with optimization (i.e., deterministic and stochastic optimization). Furthermore, only a minority had performed stochastic evaluation that incorporates biomass supply chain uncertainties. This review discussed six quantifiable uncertainties, include: (i) biomass availability, (ii) biomass quality, (iii) transportation cost, (iv) market demand, (v) fluctuation of pricing, and (vi) wages of workers.},

Based on remote sensing and ground data, harvest residue and fire residue feedstocks were identified within the boundaries of the community and inside a radius of 200 km at 18 and 39 oven-dry metric tonnes (odt)/ha, respectively. CLFN also received woody biomass from local oil and gas producers that operate in their traditional territory, which is estimated at 19,000 odt/year. Despite being abundant, the woody biomass is difficult to access due to the extensive human footprint that surrounds the area and constrains the landscape. In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, the potential also appears limited because the community has access to natural gas at a competitive and stable price, unlike off-grid communities. In terms of cost savings, the low oil and gas prices make the biomass resources (pellets) less competitive to utilize than the natural gas that is available in the community.},

Biorefineries can produce a product portfolio similar to that of crude-oil refineries from renewable resources and thus promote transformation towards a more sustainable bioeconomy. The actual product portfolio of a given biorefinery, however, depends on the choice and capacity of the production units used to upgrade raw materials to marketable products. Thus, to improve biorefinery product competitiveness, we apply an algorithm that combines an exact optimization algorithm nested in an Evolutionary Strategy with Geographic Information Systems to determine a wood-based biorefinery's optimal configuration, capacity, and location within the Cariboo District in Canada.

abstract = {Burning forest biomass from renewable sources has been suggested as a viable strategy to help offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the energy generation sector. Energy facilities can, in principle, be retrofitted to produce a portion of their energy from biomass. However, supply uncertainties affect costs, and are an important impediment to widespread and sustained adoption of this strategy. In this paper, we describe a general approach to assess the cost of offsetting GHG emissions at co-generation facilities by replacing two common fossil fuels, coal and natural gas, with forest harvest residue biomass for heat and electricity production. We apply the approach to a Canadian case study that identifies the price of GHG offsets that could make the use of forest residue biomass feedstock attractive. Biomass supply costs were based on a geographical assessment of industrial harvest operations in Canadian forests, biomass extraction and transportation costs, and included representation of basic ecological sustainability and technical accessibility constraints. Sensitivity analyses suggest that biomass extraction costs have the largest impact on the costs of GHG emission offsets, followed by fossil fuel prices. In the context of other evaluations of mitigation strategies in the energy generation sector, such as afforestation or industrial carbon capture, this analysis suggests that the substitution of fossil fuels by forest residue biomass could be a viable and reasonably substantive short-term alternative under appropriate GHG emission pricing schemes.},

  abstract  = {Interest in the use of bioenergy is increasing because of the need to mitigate climate change, the increasing costs and finite supply of fossil fuels, and the declining price of lumber and paper. Sound bioenergy policies must be informed by accurate estimates of potential feedstock production, rights to the production, social values and economics. Two of the main sources of bioenergy feedstock from forests are (i) harvesting residue and (ii) dead wood resulting from natural disturbances (i.e. standing dead timber). We modeled the production of bioenergy feedstock from these two sources from 2005 to 2020 for Canada's managed forest south of 60° N so that this information can be used in provincial and national strategic planning. Published estimates of harvesting residue vary widely, and our objective was to provide more precise estimates based on new forest inventory data and regional modeling. Natural disturbances result in very large quantities of dead wood on the landscape, but estimates of future stocks and annual production have not previously been made. Our estimates included a 50{\%} discount factor to net-down theoretically available quantities to a more realistic estimate of potential ecologically sustainable bioenergy feedstock. The total future annual production averaged 51 ± 17 Tg year-1 from natural disturbances and 20 ± 0.6 Tg year-1 from clearcut harvesting residues. Harvesting residue for the area logged varied spatially from a low of 1.0 ± 0.77 kg m-2 year-1 to a high of 6.7 ± 0.1 kg m-2 year-1. Dead wood production due to insects was forecast to peak in the Montane Cordillera of British Columbia (BC) at 16.7 Tg year-1 due to the current mountain pine beetle outbreak. Total dead wood production due to fire was highest in the western portion of the boreal forest (3.6 Tg year-1 in the Boreal Shield of Saskatchewan), in part due to the high frequency of fires in these ecosystems and the large area of western boreal forest, but the highest density production was in BC: {\textgreater}9 kg m-2 year-1 in the burned area. Our results showed that the dead wood stocks of 331 Tg oven-dry matter potentially available for bioenergy in 2020 are much smaller than the 3100 ± 84 Tg of dead wood stocks estimated based on ecosystem dynamics. While bioenergy use will accelerate the release of greenhouse gases compared to on-site decay, the energy is renewable and can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels. The net benefit to the atmosphere of forest bioenergy use is affected by many factors, and future research should further assess which sustainable wood-based bioenergy strategies yield the greatest net greenhouse gas benefits over the different time scales needed for post-disturbance forest recovery.

  abstract  = {This study reviews economics of production of second generation biofuels from various feedstocks, including crop and wood/forestry residues, lignocellulosic energy crops, jatropha, and algae. The study indicates that while second generation biofuels could significantly contribute to the future energy supply mix, cost is a major barrier to its commercial production in the near to medium term. Depending upon type of biofuels, feedstock prices and conversion costs, the cost of cellulosic ethanol is found to be two to three times higher than the current price of gasoline on an energy equivalent basis. The median cost (across the studies reviewed) of biodiesel produced from microalgae, a prospective feedstock, is seven times higher than the current price of diesel, although much higher cost estimates have been reported. As compared with the case of first generation biofuels, in which feedstock can account for over two-thirds of the total costs, the share of feedstock in the total costs is relatively lower (30-50{\%}) in the case of second generation biofuels. While significant cost reductions are needed for both types of second generation biofuels, the critical barriers are at different steps of the production process. For cellulosic ethanol, the biomass conversion costs needs to be reduced. On the other hand, feedstock cost is the main issue for biodiesel. At present, policy instruments, such as fiscal incentives and consumption mandates have in general not differentiated between the first and second generation biofuels except in the cases of the US and EU. The policy regime should be revised to account for the relative merits of different types of biofuels. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The amount of sawmill residue available in Canada to support the emerging cellulosic ethanol industry was examined. A material flow analysis technique was employed to determine the amount of sawmill residue that could possibly be available to the ethanol industry per annum. A combination of two key trends-improved efficiency of lumber recovery and increased uptake of sawmill residues for self-generation and for wood pellet production-have contributed to a declining trend of sawmill residue availability. Approximately 2.3×106 bone-dry tonnes per year of sawmill residue was estimated to be potentially available to the cellulosic ethanol industry in Canada, yielding 350 million liters per year of cellulosic ethanol using best practices. An additional 2.7 billion liters of cellulosic ethanol might be generated from sawmill residue that is currently used for competing wood energy purposes, including wood pellet generation. Continued competition between bioenergy options will reduce the industrial sustainability of the forest industry. Recommendations for policy reforms towards improved industrial sustainability practices are provided. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Strategies for increasing the mobilization of forest biomass supply chains for bioenergy production require continuous assessments of the spatial and temporal availability of biomass feedstock. Using remote sensing products at a 250-m pixel resolution, estimates of theoretical biomass availability from harvest residues and fire-killed trees were computed by combining Canada-wide maps of forest attributes (2001) and of yearly (2002–2011) fires and harvests. At the national scale, biomass availability was estimated at 47 ± 18 M ODT year−1from fire-killed trees and at 14 ± 2 M ODT year−1from harvest residues. Mean biomass densities in burned and harvested pixels were estimated at 34 ± 3.0 ODT ha−1and at 24 ± 1.2 ODT ha−1, respectively. Mean biomass densities also varied dramatically among ecozones, from 14 ODT ha−1to 206 ODT ha−1and from 6 ODT ha−1to 63 ODT ha−1for burned and harvested pixels, respectively. Spatial averaging with a 100-km radius window shows distinct hotspots of biomass availability across Canada. The largest hotspots from fire-killed trees reached 3.6 M ODT year−1in the Boreal Shield and the Boreal Plains ecozones of northern Alberta and Saskatchewan, where fires are large and frequent. The largest hotspots from harvest residues reached 1.2 M ODT year−1in the Montane Cordillera ecozone of British Columbia. The use of spatially explicit remote sensing products yields estimates of theoretical biomass availability that are methodologically consistent across Canada. Future development should include validations with on-the-ground forest inventories as well as the factoring in of environmental, technical and economic considerations to implement operational biomass supply chains.},
