	abstract = {The Canadian ethanol industry has grown rapidly and is approaching a crossroads. Government funding has played a role in increasing domestic ethanol production, but the future of such funding is uncertain. Government renewable fuel mandates have helped create a demand for ethanol, but domestic production will soon achieve the mandates. Therefore, the Canadian ethanol industry ﬁnds itself in a situation where current policies have largely been played out, and within a global market where large established players dominate market share. Within this context, the future prospects for Canadian ethanol are highly uncertain, being dependent on public policies, the future price of oil, and technological progress that could tilt production towards second-generation feedstock, where Canada may have a comparative advantage.},

	abstract = {Bioenergy is booming as nations seek to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union declared biofuels to be carbon-neutral, triggering a surge in wood use. But do biofuels actually reduce emissions? A molecule of CO2 emitted today has the same impact on radiative forcing whether it comes from coal or biomass. Biofuels can only reduce atmospheric CO2 over time through post-harvest increases in net primary production (NPP). The climate impact of biofuels therefore depends on CO2 emissions from combustion of biofuels versus fossil fuels, the fate of the harvested land and dynamics of NPP. Here we develop a model for dynamic bioenergy lifecycle analysis. The model tracks carbon stocks and ﬂuxes among the atmosphere, biomass, and soils, is extensible to multiple land types and regions, and runs in ≈1s, enabling rapid, interactive policy design and sensitivity testing. We simulate substitution of wood for coal in power generation, estimating the parameters governing NPP and other ﬂuxes using data for forests in the eastern US and using published estimates for supply chain emissions. Because combustion and processing efﬁciencies for wood are less than coal, the immediate impact of substituting wood for coal is an increase in atmospheric CO2 relative to coal. The payback time for this carbon debt ranges from 44–104 years after clearcut, depending on forest type—assuming the land remains forest. Surprisingly, replanting hardwood forests with fast-growing pine plantations raises the CO2 impact of wood because the equilibrium carbon density of plantations is lower than natural forests. Further, projected growth in wood harvest for bioenergy would increase atmospheric CO2 for at least a century because new carbon debt continuously exceeds NPP. Assuming biofuels are carbon neutral may worsen irreversible impacts of climate change before beneﬁts accrue. Instead, explicit dynamic models should be used to assess the climate impacts of biofuels.},

We simulate three policy changes: (i) permitting an increase in harvest levels on public land as a result of establishing hybrid poplar plantations on private land; (ii) permitting the establishment of hybrid poplar plantations on public land; and (iii) including forest carbon emission offsets in the net beneﬁts realized by the forest operator. We are interested in whether the increase in harvest created by the policies might be enough to supply a bioreﬁnery, and how the value of the operation changes. Our results suggest that jointly managing public and private lands under sustained yield can increase harvest by between 7\% and 93\%, and increase the value of the operation by between 39\% and 263\%. Results also suggest that hybrid poplar plantations could enable a leaseholder of one million hectares of public forestland to initiate an allowable cut effect and thereby increase harvest enough to supply a new bioreﬁnery, in addition to its existing pulp mill. Carbon offsets further increase the value of the forest, although harvest begins to decline at high carbon prices.},

	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that management intensity zoning systems, such as the triad approach, could allow Canada’s forest industry to maintain or increase timber harvest levels while simultaneously reducing its environmental impact. In most such studies, the zones are exogenously speciﬁed. In this study, we use a linear programming model to endogenously allocate forest land to management intensity zones given several alternative policy scenario formulations. We examine how alternative policy scenarios aﬀect the net present value of the optimal forest management plan, timber output, and the spatial allocation of land to management intensity zones. We conclude that policies which facilitate optimal zoning could enable land use specialization to increase both proﬁts and ecological protection. Such zoning, however, can only happen if provincial governments in Canada revise their forest policies with respect to allocation of forest tenures and establishment of exotic plantations on public forest land.},

	abstract = {The availability of corn stover can vary considerably from year to year in a region due to annual changes in yield and area planted with corn. Such variations interacting with biomass market structures can affect biomass cost and utilization rate. This study ﬁrst characterizes year-to-year variations in corn stover supply for the US in general and for selected major US corn producing counties in particular. There have been 20–30\% year-to-year variations in stover supply in the US since 1975. Game theoretic analysis is then applied to examining corn stover utilization rate and production cost in three market structures. The analysis reveals that a free market structure will take the form of oligopoly–oligopsony, where large stover supply variations will expose both bioreﬁneries and farmers to signiﬁcant price volatility. Price equilibrium will shift signiﬁcantly from year to year. Of the three market structures analysed, the “Derisked” supply market structure will be most favorable to bioreﬁneries and farmers. Under this structure, bioreﬁneries will maintain a stover supply region that is based on “Derisked” (lower than average) yield density to buffer for the supply uncertainty associated with annual variations. This market structure results in signiﬁcantly less volatility in biomass cost while on average only 63\% of collectable stover will be used for biofuel production. Our ﬁndings suggest that year-to-year variation in corn stover availability will increase feedstock cost and reduce its potential for biofuel production.},

Yet despite an unfavourable environment the sector experienced an above-average productivity performance, driven in particular by the wood product manufacturing subsector. While the forestry and logging subsector has also benefited from strong productivity gains, the productivity performance of the paper manufacturing subsector has been far from impressive, especially in the post-2008 period. This article provides a detailed analysis of output, input and productivity trends in the Canadian forest products sector. It also looks at the key drivers of productivity in the sector, investigating potential barriers to productivity growth and discussing policies that could enable faster growth. Given the increasing role of countries with low-labour costs in several forest product markets, maintaining robust productivity growth is an imperative for the Canadian forest products sector if it wants to remain competitive internationally. In this sense, the article recommends renewed focus on human and physical capital investment, as well as on R\&D spending.},

  abstract = {The estimation of aboveground biomass density (organic dry mass per unit area) is required for balancing Canadian national forest carbon budgets. Tree biomass equations are the basic tool for converting inventory plot data into biomass density. New sets of national tree biomass equations have therefore been produced from archival biomass data collected at the beginning of the 1980s through the ENergy from the FORest research program (ENFOR) of the Canadian Forest Service. Since the sampling plan was not standardized among provinces and territories, data had to be harmonized before any biomass equation could be considered at the national level. Two features characterize the new equations: estimated biomass of the compartments (foliage, branch, wood, and bark) are constrained to equal the total biomass, and dependence among error terms for the considered compartments of the same tree is taken into account in the estimates of both the model parameters and the variance prediction. The estimation method known to economists as "seemingly unrelated regression" allowed the inclusion of dependencies among the error terms of the considered biomass compartments. Sets of equations based on diameter at breast height (dbh) and on dbh and height have been produced for 33 species, groups of hardwood and softwood, and for all species combined. Biomass predicted by the new equations was compared with that estimated from provincial equations to evaluate the loss of accuracy when scaling up from the regional to the national scale. Bias and error of prediction from the set of national equations based on dbh and height were generally more similar to those from provincial equations than to those of predictions from the set of equations based on dbh alone. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

We analyzed growth rates and costs for producing hybrid poplar in the Peace River region of western Canada – an area previously identified as a preferred location for a large biorefinery. We estimated financial returns for two hybrid poplar management systems: (i) a single-stem system that involves the planting and harvesting of individual trees according to optimal economic rotations of 20–26 years, and (ii) a coppice (multi-stem) system that involves multiple harvests of new shoots that sprout from stumps following harvest every 3–4 years. Results suggest that the coppice system is financially inferior (with estimated costs of 202 {\$} Mg−1) to the single-stem system (with estimated costs of 125 {\$} Mg−1), largely due to the cost of establishing the high density coppice plantations. But even the single-stem production system does not appear to be financially feasible given the current environment of high land prices and low biomass prices. In contrast to estimated costs of growing poplar, current biomass prices for agriculture and forestry residues are approximately 50 {\$} Mg−1. However, even though purpose grown energy crops are more expensive than residues, they could be valuable in supplementing a biorefinery's feedstock supply during years when residue yields are low. If governments in Canada wish to encourage renewable energy from cellulosic feedstock, then current economic conditions suggest that subsidies aimed at biomass production are likely required.},

  abstract  = {Purpose of Review: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive but concise review of the various quantitative methods, in particular, optimization techniques, for the efficient management and control of complex forest biomass supply chains. The review is structured around a top-down hierarchical planning approach that includes strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. At each planning level, the review presents and analyses the problem to be solved, the solution (optimization) methods, and the various aspects to take into consideration for the successful implementation and use of these methods by biomass supply chain planners. Recent Findings: Forest biomass constitutes one of the various sources of renewable energy with the potential to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. Fo rest biomass supply chains are systems with complex network designs consisting of many supply, demand, and intermediate points where the biomass is collected, stored, processed, and transported. The complexity of these supply chains as well as various factors impact the effective supply of forest-based biomass. For example, the biomass characteristics (e.g., energy content or quality), the variability in the market and economic conditions, and processing of the biomass are the main factors. The complexity requires a good understanding of the methods that exist to manage and optimize forest biomass supply chains. Summary: Although substantial research has been done around forest biomass supply chain management and optimization, future research should focus on developing integrated frameworks that allow the optimization of biomass supply chains at the strategic, tactical, and operational level. These studies should also explore and propose approaches for the successful implementation of the proposed optimization methods.},

  abstract  = {Forest biomass is one of the renewable and sustainable sources of energy that can be used for producing electricity, heat, and biofuels. The complex supply chain of forest biomass for energy generation, which consists of different players and products and is affected by biomass characteristics, such as low density and unpredictable quality, makes the energy generation cost from biomass higher than that of the conventional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. Moreover, variability and uncertainty in this supply chain, mainly due to the nature of material, economic condition and market fluctuation, affect the amount of produced energy and its cost. Mathematical modeling, in particular optimization techniques, can be employed to manage the supply chain and achieve the optimum design. This paper reviews studies which used deterministic and stochastic mathematical models to optimize forest biomass supply chains for electricity, heat and biofuels production. Optimization models were used to provide the optimum solution for decisions related to the network design, technology choice, plant size and location, storage location, mix of products and raw materials, logistics options, supply areas, and material flows. Mainly, economic objectives were considered in these models. Further studies should consider environmental and social objectives, in addition to the economic ones, in the models. In non-deterministic models uncertainty mainly in the demand, supply, prices, and conversion yields were incorporated. Although material quality is an important uncertain parameter in the forest biomass supply chain that affects the amount and cost of produced energy, its variation was not considered in previous studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Biomass logistics comprise of inter-dependent operations related to harvesting and collection, storage, pre-processing, and transportation. Its high cost represents one of the barriers in widespread use of biomass for energy and fuel production. Therefore, improving and optimizing biomass logistics are essential in overcoming this barrier. Biomass logistics was reviewed in a previous study that aimed at categorizing logistics operations, but the inherent issues and complexities, and how they were incorporated in mathematical models were not discussed in detail. The objective of this paper is to review the important features of biomass logistics operations, discuss how they were incorporated in mathematical optimization models, and explain the new trends in biomass logistics optimization. Differences between the models dealing with forest-based and agriculture-based biomass are highlighted. Important features incorporated in logistics models include demand-driven and supply-driven collection, collection of biomass in different forms, storage at intermediate facilities, biomass quality deterioration, inter-modal distribution for long-distance transportation, operational level transportation planning, and planning the pre-processing of biomass. Recent trends in biomass logistics models include the consideration of scattered availability of biomass across supply areas, uncertainties in biomass supply, integration with GIS, emissions from logistics operations, and traffic congestion due to biomass transportation. Most of the literature on biomass logistics focused on medium-term planning, while that for short-term planning is still in its infancy. The current biomass logistics models focused mainly on economic objectives, while environmental concerns related to emissions from logistics activities received limited attention. The trade-off between environmental and economic aspects of biomass logistics operations have not been investigated. Social aspects such as increase in traffic congestion due to biomass transportation received limited attention in the literature. Most of the previous models were tested on hypothetical cases, while developing suitable models to address practical issues in real case studies would be valuable.},

  abstract  = {Given the increasing risk of climate change and depletion of non-renewable energy sources, countries around the world have been looking into energy profile diversification whereby biomass represents one of the most appealing alternatives for energy production feedstock. To attract interest and more investment from industry players into biomass-based industries, comprehensive techno-economic analysis has to be performed. In addition, various uncertainties related to supply chain such as biomass attainability, demand variation, and material price fluctuation, have to be considered in the evaluation to yield more accurate and reliable feasibility estimation. This review paper aims to: (i) provide an overview on the different types of methods or approaches used in the feasibility evaluation of biomass-based industries from the techno-economic point of view, and (ii) outline the supply chain uncertainties that should be incorporated into the evaluation model using a Malaysian case study to illustrate the impact of these uncertainties. Apart from that, some of the unquantifiable uncertainties and risks are critically reviewed in this paper. It was found that 78 {\%} of the reviewed articles opted for mathematical modelling evaluation method with the majority leaning towards mathematical modelling with optimization (i.e., deterministic and stochastic optimization). Furthermore, only a minority had performed stochastic evaluation that incorporates biomass supply chain uncertainties. This review discussed six quantifiable uncertainties, include: (i) biomass availability, (ii) biomass quality, (iii) transportation cost, (iv) market demand, (v) fluctuation of pricing, and (vi) wages of workers.},

In this study, we collaborated with Cold Lake First Nations (CLFN), a community located in Northern Alberta, Canada, to investigate the opportunities and challenges of biomass mobilization from different feedstocks. Based on remote sensing and ground data, harvest residue and fire residue feedstocks were identified within the boundaries of the community and inside a radius of 200 km at 18 and 39 oven-dry metric tonnes (odt)/ha, respectively. CLFN also received woody biomass from local oil and gas producers that operate in their traditional territory, which is estimated at 19,000 odt/year. Despite being abundant, the woody biomass is difficult to access due to the extensive human footprint that surrounds the area and constrains the landscape. In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, the potential also appears limited because the community has access to natural gas at a competitive and stable price, unlike off-grid communities. In terms of cost savings, the low oil and gas prices make the biomass resources (pellets) less competitive to utilize than the natural gas that is available in the community.},

However, the availability of crude oil is limited and the combustion of fossil fuels contributes to global warming. Biorefineries can produce a product portfolio similar to that of crude-oil refineries from renewable resources and thus promote transformation towards a more sustainable bioeconomy. The actual product portfolio of a given biorefinery, however, depends on the choice and capacity of the production units used to upgrade raw materials to marketable products. Thus, to improve biorefinery product competitiveness, we apply an algorithm that combines an exact optimization algorithm nested in an Evolutionary Strategy with Geographic Information Systems to determine a wood-based biorefinery's optimal configuration, capacity, and location within the Cariboo District in Canada. The results indicate that there are numerous locations with similarly attractive economic potentials for biorefineries with 450,000 to 550,000 tons of biomass input capacity in the investigated area.},

  abstract = {Burning forest biomass from renewable sources has been suggested as a viable strategy to help offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the energy generation sector. Energy facilities can, in principle, be retrofitted to produce a portion of their energy from biomass. However, supply uncertainties affect costs, and are an important impediment to widespread and sustained adoption of this strategy. In this paper, we describe a general approach to assess the cost of offsetting GHG emissions at co-generation facilities by replacing two common fossil fuels, coal and natural gas, with forest harvest residue biomass for heat and electricity production. We apply the approach to a Canadian case study that identifies the price of GHG offsets that could make the use of forest residue biomass feedstock attractive. Biomass supply costs were based on a geographical assessment of industrial harvest operations in Canadian forests, biomass extraction and transportation costs, and included representation of basic ecological sustainability and technical accessibility constraints. Sensitivity analyses suggest that biomass extraction costs have the largest impact on the costs of GHG emission offsets, followed by fossil fuel prices. In the context of other evaluations of mitigation strategies in the energy generation sector, such as afforestation or industrial carbon capture, this analysis suggests that the substitution of fossil fuels by forest residue biomass could be a viable and reasonably substantive short-term alternative under appropriate GHG emission pricing schemes.},

  abstract  = {Interest in the use of bioenergy is increasing because of the need to mitigate climate change, the increasing costs and finite supply of fossil fuels, and the declining price of lumber and paper. Sound bioenergy policies must be informed by accurate estimates of potential feedstock production, rights to the production, social values and economics. Two of the main sources of bioenergy feedstock from forests are (i) harvesting residue and (ii) dead wood resulting from natural disturbances (i.e. standing dead timber). We modeled the production of bioenergy feedstock from these two sources from 2005 to 2020 for Canada's managed forest south of 60° N so that this information can be used in provincial and national strategic planning. Published estimates of harvesting residue vary widely, and our objective was to provide more precise estimates based on new forest inventory data and regional modeling. Natural disturbances result in very large quantities of dead wood on the landscape, but estimates of future stocks and annual production have not previously been made. Our estimates included a 50{\%} discount factor to net-down theoretically available quantities to a more realistic estimate of potential ecologically sustainable bioenergy feedstock. The total future annual production averaged 51 ± 17 Tg year-1 from natural disturbances and 20 ± 0.6 Tg year-1 from clearcut harvesting residues. Harvesting residue for the area logged varied spatially from a low of 1.0 ± 0.77 kg m-2 year-1 to a high of 6.7 ± 0.1 kg m-2 year-1. Dead wood production due to insects was forecast to peak in the Montane Cordillera of British Columbia (BC) at 16.7 Tg year-1 due to the current mountain pine beetle outbreak. Total dead wood production due to fire was highest in the western portion of the boreal forest (3.6 Tg year-1 in the Boreal Shield of Saskatchewan), in part due to the high frequency of fires in these ecosystems and the large area of western boreal forest, but the highest density production was in BC: {\textgreater}9 kg m-2 year-1 in the burned area. Our results showed that the dead wood stocks of 331 Tg oven-dry matter potentially available for bioenergy in 2020 are much smaller than the 3100 ± 84 Tg of dead wood stocks estimated based on ecosystem dynamics. While bioenergy use will accelerate the release of greenhouse gases compared to on-site decay, the energy is renewable and can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels. The net benefit to the atmosphere of forest bioenergy use is affected by many factors, and future research should further assess which sustainable wood-based bioenergy strategies yield the greatest net greenhouse gas benefits over the different time scales needed for post-disturbance forest recovery.

  abstract  = {This study reviews economics of production of second generation biofuels from various feedstocks, including crop and wood/forestry residues, lignocellulosic energy crops, jatropha, and algae. The study indicates that while second generation biofuels could significantly contribute to the future energy supply mix, cost is a major barrier to its commercial production in the near to medium term. Depending upon type of biofuels, feedstock prices and conversion costs, the cost of cellulosic ethanol is found to be two to three times higher than the current price of gasoline on an energy equivalent basis. The median cost (across the studies reviewed) of biodiesel produced from microalgae, a prospective feedstock, is seven times higher than the current price of diesel, although much higher cost estimates have been reported. As compared with the case of first generation biofuels, in which feedstock can account for over two-thirds of the total costs, the share of feedstock in the total costs is relatively lower (30-50{\%}) in the case of second generation biofuels. While significant cost reductions are needed for both types of second generation biofuels, the critical barriers are at different steps of the production process. For cellulosic ethanol, the biomass conversion costs needs to be reduced. On the other hand, feedstock cost is the main issue for biodiesel. At present, policy instruments, such as fiscal incentives and consumption mandates have in general not differentiated between the first and second generation biofuels except in the cases of the US and EU. The policy regime should be revised to account for the relative merits of different types of biofuels. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Strategies for increasing the mobilization of forest biomass supply chains for bioenergy production require continuous assessments of the spatial and temporal availability of biomass feedstock. Using remote sensing products at a 250-m pixel resolution, estimates of theoretical biomass availability from harvest residues and fire-killed trees were computed by combining Canada-wide maps of forest attributes (2001) and of yearly (2002–2011) fires and harvests. At the national scale, biomass availability was estimated at 47 ± 18 M ODT year−1from fire-killed trees and at 14 ± 2 M ODT year−1from harvest residues. Mean biomass densities in burned and harvested pixels were estimated at 34 ± 3.0 ODT ha−1and at 24 ± 1.2 ODT ha−1, respectively. Mean biomass densities also varied dramatically among ecozones, from 14 ODT ha−1to 206 ODT ha−1and from 6 ODT ha−1to 63 ODT ha−1for burned and harvested pixels, respectively. Spatial averaging with a 100-km radius window shows distinct hotspots of biomass availability across Canada. The largest hotspots from fire-killed trees reached 3.6 M ODT year−1in the Boreal Shield and the Boreal Plains ecozones of northern Alberta and Saskatchewan, where fires are large and frequent. The largest hotspots from harvest residues reached 1.2 M ODT year−1in the Montane Cordillera ecozone of British Columbia. The use of spatially explicit remote sensing products yields estimates of theoretical biomass availability that are methodologically consistent across Canada. Future development should include validations with on-the-ground forest inventories as well as the factoring in of environmental, technical and economic considerations to implement operational biomass supply chains.},

  abstract = {The ethanol industry in North America uses starch derived from corn as its primary feedstock. In order to better understand the geographical distribution of advanced ethanol production, potential sources of lignocellulosic biomass for the process are considered. It is shown that the corn-producing regions of North America already support signiﬁcant amounts of ethanol production, and that few unexploited sources of corn remain for the industry to utilize. Accessing other sources of sugar, including other types of biomass such as lignocellulosic materials, will become necessary for the industry as it expands, quite apart from the need to meet government mandates. The ability of bioconversion and thermochemical conversion to generate biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass is reviewed. The availability of lignocellulosic residues from agricultural and forestry operations is described, and the potential biofuel production associated with these residues is described. A residue-based process could greatly extend the potential of the ethanol industry to become a substantial contributor to the fuel and energy requirements of North America. It is estimated that ethanol production from residues could provide up to 13.7\% of Canada’s 2009 transportation fuel demand, and up to 5.2\% of the United States’ 2010 fuel demand. Utilizing lignocellulosic biomass will extend the geographic range of the biofuel industry, and increase the stability and security of this sector by reducing the impact of localized disruptions in supply. Development of a residue-based industry will help create the technologies needed to process energy crops as North America moves towards greater transportation fuel independence.},

  abstract = {The power cost and optimum plant size for power plants using three biomass fuels in western Canada were determined. The three fuels are biomass from agricultural residues (grain straw), whole boreal forest, and forest harvest residues from existing lumber and pulp operations (limbs and tops). Forest harvest residues have the smallest economic size, 137 MW, and the highest power cost, \$63:00 MWh−1 (Year 2000 US\$). The optimum size for agricultural residues is 450 MW (the largest single biomass unit judged feasible in this study), and the power cost is \$50:30 MWh−1. If a larger biomass boiler could be built, the optimum project size for straw would be 628 MW. Whole forest harvesting has an optimum size of 900 MW (two maximum sized units), and a power cost of \$47:16 MWh−1 without nutrient replacement. However, power cost versus size from whole forest is essentially at from 450 MW (\$47:76 MWh−1) to 3150 MW (\$48:86 MWh−1), so the optimum size is better thought of as a wide range.},

  abstract = {Canada’s National Forest Inventory (NFI) sampling program is designed to support reporting on forests at the national scale. On the other hand, continuous maps of forest attributes are required to support strategic analyses of regional policy and management issues. We have therefore produced maps covering 4.03 × 106 km2 of inventoried forest area for the 2001 base year using standardised observations from the NFI photo plots (PP) as reference data. We used the k nearest neighbours (kNN) method with 26 geospatial data layers including MODIS spectral data and climatic and topographic variables to produce maps of 127 forest attributes at a 250 × 250 m resolution. The stand-level attributes include land cover, structure, and tree species relative abundance. In this article, we report only on total live aboveground tree biomass, with all other attributes covered in the supplementary data (http://nrcresearchpress.com/doi/suppl/10.1139/cjfr-2013-0401). In general, deviations in predicted pixel-level values from those in a PP validation set are greater in mountainous regions and in areas with either low biomass or sparse PP sampling. Predicted pixel-level values are overestimated at small observed values and underestimated at large ones. Accuracy measures are improved through the spatial aggregation of pixels to 1 km2 and beyond. Overall, these new products provide unique baseline information for strategic-level analyses of forests (https://nﬁ.nﬁs.org).},

Cost curves of ten supply chains for logging residues and full trees based on roadside, terminal and end-facility chipping were analyzed. The average procurement costs from forest to roadside storage were included. Railway transportation was compared to the most commonly used truck transportation options in long-distance transport.

  abstract = {There is growing interest in the production of biofuels from woody biomass. Critical to the ﬁnancial success of producing biofuel is identifying the optimal location for the facility. The location decision is especially important for woody biomass feedstock owing to the distributed nature of biomass and the signiﬁcant costs associated with transportation. This study introduces a two-stage methodology to identify the best location for biofuel production based on multiple attributes. Stage I uses a Geographic Information System approach to identify feasible biofuel facility locations. The approach employs county boundaries, a county-based pulpwood distribution, a population census, city and village distributions, and railroad and state/federal road transportation networks. In Stage II, the preferred location is selected using a total transportation cost model. The methodology is applied to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to locate a biofuel production facility. Through the application of the two-stage methodology, the best possible location for biofuel production was identiﬁed as the Village of L’anse in Baraga County. Also investigated are the sensitivity of transportation cost and the optimal site for biofuel production to changes in several key variables. These additional variables included fuel price, transportation distance, and pulpwood availability. By applying sensitivity analysis based on limited availability of feedstock, the City of Ishpeming emerged as another viable location for the production facility.},

Approximately 259 000 oven dry tonnes of sawmill residues are produced annually in eastern Ontario, but most of this fibre is absorbed by existing markets and would not be available for bioenergy or pellet initiatives. However, another source of wood fibre exists that is both abundant and unutilized: traditional pulpwood. While establishment costs of bioenergy and pellet facilities are high, pulpwood is locally available in large quantities.

  abstract   = {Residual forest biomass is an attractive feedstock for bioenergy production due to its abundance and renewability. However, natural forest disturbances such as wildﬁre and insect infestation cause unpredictable ﬂuctuations in supply, disrupting long-term procurement plans for delivering feedstock to bioreﬁneries. This study proposes a method to assess the impact of disturbances on long-term supply of residual forest biomass. The method was integrated within a framework of forest management planning for timber production, reﬂecting current reality of commercially-managed forests. The method was implemented to a case study in eastern Canada focusing on the two most prevalent forest disturbances, wildﬁre and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [Clemen]) infestation. Nine scenarios were considered, with disturbance rates ranging from 0 to 1.6\% yrÀ1 (predicted maximum). Residual biomass considered in this study were (i) logging residue, (ii) salvage biomass, and (iii) sawmill residue. The results show that, as the disturbance rate increases, the area available for timber harvest decreases, leading to a reduction in logging and sawmill residues. In the highest disturbance rate scenario, logging and sawmill residue decreases by almost 40\%. Collection of salvage biomass can make up for the reduction, redeeming approximately 20\% of the loss. Our method complements the conventional timber production planning process, allowing quantiﬁcation of residual biomass supply in the face of uncertain natural disturbances due to climate change. The proposed method should support managers in their effort to maintain robust supply chains, while facilitating the adoption of the principles of circular economy.},

  abstract = {The relationship between forest management and biomass sourcing is fundamental to the achievement of sustainable bioenergy production. Few biomass-sourcing studies have directly addressed the complex interactions between sustainable forest management and additional demand created by bioenergy production. The first objective of this research was to provide a method for estimating profits for a value chain that harvests volumes scheduled in a sustainable forest management plan. The second objective was to measure the financial and sustainable benefits generated by integrating bioenergy production into this value chain. Using data from a large management unit, a forest management plan was developed to generate an annual flow of timber that can be produced sustainably. We then proposed a network flow optimization model that links the optimal solution of a long-term wood supply optimization model with the processing capacity of an industrial network. Results revealed that the weak demand for lower-quality trees could be a serious impediment to achieving full valuecreation potential. Simulations of the implementation of a hardwood pellet mill improved the value-creation potential for hardwood pulp (direct effect) and also for other wood products by providing access to otherwise unprofitable mixed-wood forest strata (synergistic effect). Our experiment showed that integrating a lowerquality timber user, such as a bioenergy production unit, could lead to higher financial profits (up to three-fold), and improve alignment between the sustainable forest management objectives and the industrial network capacity (harvested scheduled area increased from 79\% to 98\%). Implementing a bioenergy mill also grants a higher return on capital employed compared to historical values for the manufacturing sector. Strengthening the link between strategic planning and industrial processing capacity provides new insights into the impact on value-creation of bioenergy production from forest biomass.},

Forest biomass as a feedstock is non-uniform, voluminous and high in moisture content (MC). This leads to inefﬁciencies during transportation and energy conversion process, posing a challenge for supply chains to remain proﬁtable. The problem is exacerbated by seasonality in both supply and demand. A terminal in the biomass feedstock supply chain could help overcome these challenges, but adds a signiﬁcant cost. A novel multi-period mixed-integer programming (MIP) model capable of taking into consideration biomass quality, seasonality, and weather related supply restrictions was developed. The model was applied in a case study to assess the beneﬁts of incorporating a terminal in the supply chain. It was demonstrated that a terminal allowed delivery of feedstock 4–11\% lower in MC, while reducing procurement costs by 11–32\%. The beneﬁts reported are sensitive to transportation and operating costs. The proposed model will serve as a valuable tool for practitioners to design supply chains, and assess the feasibility of using forest biomass for sustainable biofuels production.},

Wildfire suppression costs in British Columbia have exceeded the set budget in 9 of the last 10 years and the province has only reduced the fuel load on a fraction of the high-risk hectares. Using a novel high-moisture mobile pellet mill allows the production of 89,000 tonnes of wood pellets each year for a price of \$293 tonne−1. Each tonne produced also provides \$546 tonne−1 in additional benefits from employment, taxation, and reductions in the cost to perform fuel treatments. The presented research found that 11 employees are needed to operate a mobile pellet mill, with total employment of 242 for 22 systems across BC. The assessed system can also avoid \$5.5 million in employment insurance payments. The 22 systems also provide \$323,000 in taxable profits and \$524,000 from income taxes from employees. Fuel treatment with the researched systems costs \$1112 ha−1. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the system provides \$2.97 in benefits for every dollar invested.},

Wildfire suppression costs have consistently exceeded British Columbia’s budget set for such activities. Pelletization of excess wood for bioenergy applications has been proposed as a possible method of reducing the overall costs of fighting wildfires. In this study, a traditional pellet mill produces wood pellets from new, marginal feedstocks for \$182.24 ± 24.47 tonne−1 and a mobile pellet production system produces wood pellets for \$402.71 ± 24.18 tonne−1. The traditional pellet mill produces 90,000 tonnes∙yr−1 with harvest residues being collected in the forest, transported to the pellet mill, dried, chipped, pelletized and then stored. The mobile system collects harvest residues from the forest, transports them to the forest landing where the trailer-mounted mobile pellet system is established and is then ground, pelletized and dried if needed. The mobile system uses a novel high moisture pelletization system and harvest residues to heat the biomass dryer used in the system. The mobile pellet system requires 22 systems to produce 90,000 tonnes∙yr−1 and each system should relocate 9 times in a year to minimize production costs related to feedstock quality and scarcity. These mobile pellet systems can allow increased forest management in forest areas at high risk for wildfires and reduce the cost of suppressing wildfires in treated areas.},

  abstract = {Forest residues are renewable materials for bioenergy conversion that have the potential to replace fossil fuels beyond electricity and heat generation. A challenge hindering the intensified use of forest residues for energy production is the high cost of their supply chain. Previous studies on optimal design of forest residue supply chains focused on biofuel or bioenergy production separately, mostly with a single time period approach. We present a multi-period mixed integer linear programming model that optimizes the supply chain of forest residues for the production of bioenergy and biofuels simultaneously. The model determines (i) the location, type and size of the technologies to install and the period to install them, (ii) the mix of biofuel and bioenergy products to generate, (iii) the type and amount of forest residues to acquire and the sourcing points, (iv) the amount of forest residues to transport from sources to facilities and (v) the amount of product to transport from facilities to markets. The objective of the model is to maximize the net present value of the supply chain over a 20-year planning horizon with yearly time steps. We applied the model to a case study in British Columbia, Canada, to investigate the production of heat, electricity, pellets and pyrolysis bio-oil from available forest harvesting residues and sawmill wastes. Based on current energy generation costs in the region and the predicted operating costs of new conversion plants, the results of our model recommended the installation of small biomass boilers coupled with steam turbines for electricity production (0.5 and 5 MW) and pyrolysis plants with a capacity of 200 and 400 odmt day−1. We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of the optimal result to changes in the demand and price of products, as well as the availability and cost of forest residues.

Since then, this concept has evolved and it now considers now the three sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental and social) of the whole forest wood supply chain. The main objective of this study is then to review assessment and optimization studies that consider the forest wood supply chain and at least one of the sustainability dimensions. To accomplish this goal, a total number of 188 papers, published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals from 1995 to 2017, were reviewed. These papers have been classified according to the sustainability dimensions explored, the stakeholder’s involvement, the modeling approaches applied, the supply chain decision levels treated, the uncertainty inclusion, and case study analyzed. Most of the studies reviewed (84.6\%) considered only two sustainability dimensions: economic (31.9\%), environmental (13.8\%), or a combination of both (38.8\%). The first study including the three sustainability dimensions was published in 2005. Most of the studies reviewed (64.9\%) focus on the bioenergy industry in Europe and North America, due to the growing interest in using biomass to substitute fossil fuels in energy production. The final part of the paper presents the identified specific features of sustainable forest wood supply chains and discusses a future research agenda in the area.},

  abstract   = {Large quantities of residual forest-based biomass, including harvesting and sawmill residues, are available in British Columbia, Canada. They can be used to generate bioenergy. Currently, harvesting residues are burned to reduce fire hazard, and private and remote sawmills’ residues are either burned or landfilled. While previous studies assessed the impact of bioenergy production from residual forest-based biomass on global warming, this life cycle assessment includes a comprehensive set of ten impact categories. Adopting a case study in a region in British Columbia, a life cycle model is applied to three locations considering four combustion and gasification technologies with different capacities (0.5 MW, 2 MW, 3 MW and 5 MW) and product outputs (electricity and/or heat). Most bioenergy supply chain scenarios showed improved environmental performance due to avoided uncontrolled combustion of residues and avoided fossil fuel combustion, particularly in the categories of acidification (+1\% to -71\%), eutrophication (-2\% to -85\%), fossil resource depletion (-2\% to -84\%), respiratory effects (0\% to -96\%), and photochemical ozone formation (+3\% to -59\%). Benefits were larger at locations dependent on fossil energy compared to locations dependent on hydropower. In contrast, ecotoxicity values increased in most scenarios (+460\% to -11\%), due to wood ash disposal. Results confirmed conversion efficiency and wood ash disposal as influencing factors in bioenergy supply chains for the investigated region, but showed a minor influence of the feedstock procurement distance. Moreover, the results emphasized the high contribution of uncontrolled burnings to the overall environmental impact of the forest biomass supply chains.},

Quantifying the amount of this resource over large areas has been difﬁcult due to the lack of availability of and consistency in forest inventory data across jurisdictions and the lack of a clear deﬁnition of what constitutes logging residues. The goal of this study was to develop an approach to spatially estimate the amounts of logging residues that would potentially be available in the near future for public lands across the Canadian managed forest using remote sensing maps and to compare these estimates with ﬁeld assessments. Remote sensing estimates of branch and foliage biomass, although only a fraction of total postharvest residual biomass, were generally comparable with estimates from ﬁeld assessments of recoverable residues after harvesting at the forest management unit (FMU) scale or at the 100 km2 scale. However, they tended to not capture the strong variability between sites and to underestimate observed ﬁeld values in regions that have very high biomass density. On average, the national logging residue density is estimated to be 26 ± 16 oven-dry tonnes (ODT)·ha−1, and annual national availability is estimated to be 21 M ODT·year−1.

  abstract   = {Policy makers and investors often need to consider trade-offs between alternative biomass-based energy supply options. Supply cost potentials for three bioenergy feedstocks prevalent in Canada including agricultural residues, dedicated woody crops, and forest harvest residues are summarized. Each feedstock has its own particular cost characteristics depending on the quantities involved. Importantly, this synthesis revealed significant differences in the uncertainty associated with the cost estimates, with agricultural residues having the greatest variation, followed by woody crops and postharvest forest residues, respectively. One implication of this uncertainty is that the attractiveness of each feedstock option likely depends on local market demand conditions and producer circumstances, making definitive aggregate supply estimates challenging.},

  abstract   = {An approach to developing a wood pellet supply chain (SC) which selects among several sources of biomass feedstock is proposed. The approach is based on a downstream to upstream analysis of the SC and includes ﬁve phases: (1) Identifying potential markets and projected demands. (2) Determining feedstock types, locations, and available quantities. (3) Evaluation of raw material and ﬁnal product transportation options, potential plant location, and logistics components that can be integrated with existing forest products SCs. (4) Cost estimation of raw material supply, production, and ﬁnal product delivery. (5) Utilizing a spatially explicit optimization and generic model to determine the optimal operational conditions under which the wood pellet SC is proﬁtable while taking into account economies of scale. The model selects the best feedstock locations and determines the optimal quantities to supply as well as the optimal production capacity. The associated ROI is calculated to assess economic feasibility. To show the value of the approach, we applied it to a real case study proposed by a regional development agency interested in developing the wood pellet sector in Eastern Canada. The results show that implementing a 100,000-tonne plant using biomass harvested in the forest as the sole feedstock is proﬁtable. However, harvesting costs must be shared among the pellet mill and other forest companies and the government must provide ﬁnancial support. The use of sawmill residues in the mix of feedstock allows implementing a highly proﬁtable 50,000-tonne plant without any government support or harvesting cost sharing mechanism. Under a high wood pellet selling price, harvesting cost sharing and government support, the production capacity can reach 150,000 tonnes/year. An important ﬁnding is that government support is not necessary for ensuring proﬁtability in all cases. Government support has a signiﬁcant impact on profitability in the case where sawmill residues are not available as a feedstock for manufacturing pellets or the selling price is high enough to allow operating a proﬁtable plant of large size.},

Key components of upstream supply chain decision making are then presented through an overview and classiﬁcation of the existing methods and contributions. There is a need to classify and analyze the relevant methodologies and approaches identiﬁed in prior studies, and to subsequently assess their usefulness through empirical research and case-based analysis. Both narrative and systematic literature reviews are performed using qualitative analysis and classic bibliometric techniques to demonstrate the scope of current papers and the call for future needs. It is found, due to growing demands for bioenergy, future biomass-to-bioenergy supply chains should draw upon existing research toward the development of efﬁcient and effective forest biomass supply chain networks. It is further concluded that a new generation of pretreatment technologies is needed for techno-economic optimization of upstream forest biomass value chains.},

  abstract = {Increasing interest in making use of forest sector processing residuals for renewable energy production has led to the need for careful analyses of ﬁbre supply, and the ways in which existing forest sector ﬁrms could be affected by new sources of ﬁbre demand. In this paper we present a forest sector transportation model of the three Canadian Prairie Provinces, and use the model to estimate residual ﬁbre production, utilization and surpluses, as well as some potential forest sector impacts from bioenergy capacity additions. Under our base-case assumptions and using 2010 product prices, we estimate that 6.9 million cubic meters (round-wood equivalent) of processing residuals would be traded over the course of a year, with sawmills being the most signiﬁcant source and pulp and paper mills being the most signiﬁcant user. Approximately 33\% of residuals would be used to produce bioenergyrelated products (wood pellets, electricity sold to the grid, or internal electricity and power at pulp mills). Results show that some surpluses of processing residuals may be present in the existing supply chain, though the availability of these residuals is sensitive to lumber prices. At the same time, new bioenergy capacity itself may trigger higher sawmill output, making additional ﬁbre available for both new and existing users. Roadside harvesting residuals are not an economically viable source of ﬁbre under our base-case assumptions; however, their viability is sensitive to roadside processing costs and electricity prices.},

  abstract = {Competition for woody biomass between material and energy uses is expected to further increase in the future, due to the limited availability of forest resources and increasing demand of wood for material and bioenergy. Currently, methodological approaches for modeling wood production and delivery costs from forest to industrial gates are missing. This study combines forest engineering, geographically explicit information, environmental constraints and economics in a bottom-up approach to assess cost–supply curves. The estimates are based on a multitude of wood supply systems that were assigned according to geographically explicit forestry characteristics. For each harvesting and transportation system, efficiencies were modeled according to harvesting sites and main delivery hubs. The cost–supply curves for roundwood and logging residues as estimates for current time and for the future (2030) show that there are large regional differences in the potential to increase extraction in the EU28. In most EU Member States, the costs of logging residues extraction increase exponentially already for low levels of mobilization, while extraction of roundwood can be increased to a larger extent within reasonable costs (30–40 \$/m3). The large differences between countries in their harvest potential highlight the importance of spatially explicit analyses.},

Determining inter-year variability in biomass availability is essential to quantify the feedstock supply risk. Using a geographic information system (GIS) and historic crop yield data, average production was estimated for 10 sites in the Peace River region of Alberta, Canada. Four high-yielding potential sites were investigated for variability over a 20 year time frame (1980–2000). The range of availability was large, from double the average in maximum years to nothing in minimum years. Biomass availability is a function of grain yield, the biomass-to-grain ratio, the cropping frequency, and residue retention rate to ensure future crop productivity. Alternate feedstock sources must be identified to supply biomass processing facilities in low yield years.},

  abstract = {Biofuels supply chain comprises a wide set of activities involving a rather complex set of parameters. Cultivation of the raw materials is closely related to the agricultural sector whereas the production of the final product presumes the operation of a conversion plant. The distribution network aims at delivering the final product close to the consumption. The extent of the involvement of each one of the previously mentioned sectors is the result of strategic and operational planning of the whole supply chain and, in the general case, determines the efficiency of the biofuels sector. Taking also into account the very rapidly changing opinions related to the environmental behaviour of the whole biofuels supply chain, it becomes very clear that the parameters in the sector are continuously changing. Therefore, the consideration of an integrated supply chain appropriately modelled is believed to be very critical and could result in the optimal solution per case, economically and/or environmentally speaking. In this paper the development of a mathematical model for the optimal design and operation of Biofuels Supply Chain is proposed as an integrated approach that can take into account both technical and economic parameters affecting the performance of the whole value chain. Model implementation would facilitate and support the decision taking in various planning and operational issues such as infrastructure investments, the quantities of raw materials to be cultivated, the quantities of biofuels to be produced in the domestic market or imported, identifying the best available solution for the optimal design and operation of the biofuels supply chain.},

Plusieurs projets de bioénergie utilisent des déchets générés par les secteurs primaires comme le bois de sciage et courent donc un risque inhérent aux fluctuations de l'approvisionnement liées à un changement dans ces industries. Pour évaluer la viabilité à long terme d'une installation de bioénergie à base de bois, il est nécessaire de comprendre comment fluctue la matière première de biomasse en fonction des autres secteurs et à quel coût l'offre devient accessible. Nous abordons ces questions en élaborant un modèle de programmation mathématique positive (PMP) pour le secteur forestier de l'Alberta en se concentrant sur l'optimisation des itinéraires de transfert de la fibre. À partir du modèle de PMP, nous obtenons une fonction de coût marginal pour la récolte et le transport de la fibre jusqu'à chaque usine de transformation. Les résultats indiquent que l'approvisionnement en résidus ligneux est très sensible aux conditions du marché dans le secteur primaire. Dans la majorité des cas, afin de soutenir l'expansion de la bioénergie, la matière première devra provenir de la forêt, puisque très peu de surplus de résidus de scieries sont disponibles même lorsque les prix du bois d'œuvre sont élevés. Cependant, nous estimons que le coût marginal pour fournir des résidus de récolte est important, de telle sorte qu'un soutien politique sera nécessaire pour le développement futur de la bioénergie.},

  abstract   = {In light of the large volumes of pine killed in the interior forests of British Columbia (BC) by the mountain pine beetle, many forest sector participants are keen to employ forest biomass as an energy source. To assess the feasibility of a wood biomass-fired power plant in the BC interior, it is necessary to know both how much physical biomass might be available over the life of a plant and its location as transportation cost is likely to be a major operating cost for any facility. To address these issues, we construct a mathematical programming model of fiber flows in the Quesnel Timber Supply Area of BC over a 25-year time horizon. The focus of the model is on minimizing the cost of supplying feedstock through space and time. Results indicate that over the life of the project, feedstock costs will more than double, increasing from \$54.60/bone-dry tonnes (BDt) (\$0.039/kWh) to \$116.14/BDt (\$0.083/kWh). En raison de l’important volume de pins dévastés par le dendroctone du pin ponderosa dans les forêts de l’intérieur de la Colombie-Britannique (BC), de nombreux participants du secteur forestier sont désireux d’utiliser la biomasse forestière comme source d’énergie. Pour évaluer la faisabilité d’une centrale alimentée à la biomasse ligneuse à l’intérieur de la Colombie-Britannique, il faut connaître la quantité de biomasse disponible pendant la durée de vie de la centrale ainsi que l’emplacement de cette biomasse étant donné que les coûts de transport risquent de représenter des coûts d’exploitation importants pour n’importe quelle installation. Afin d’examiner ces aspects, nous avons élaboré un modèle de programmation mathématique de l’approvisionnement en matière ligneuse dans la zone d’approvisionnement forestier de Quesnel en Colombie-Britannique, sur un horizon de 25 ans. Le modèle visait principalement à réduire le coût liéà l’approvisionnement en matière première à travers l’espace et le temps. D’après nos résultats, les coûts de la matière première feront plus que doubler au cours de la durée du projet, passant de 54,60 \$/tonne anhydre (t.a.) (0,039 \$/kWh) à 116,14 \$/t.a. (0,083 \$/kWh).},

One of the challenges for the emerging industry is the high level of uncertainty in supply amounts, market demands, market prices, and processing technologies. These uncertainties complicate the assessment of investment decisions. This paper presents a model for the optimal design of biomass supply chain networks under uncertainty. The uncertainties manifest themselves as a large number of stochastic model parameters that could impact the overall profitability and design. The supply chain network we study covers the Southeastern region of the United States and includes biomass supply locations and amounts, candidate sites and capacities for two kinds of fuel conversion processing, and the logistics of transportation from the locations of forestry resources to the conversion sites and then to the final markets. To reduce the design problem to a manageable size the impact of each uncertain parameter on the objective function is computed for each end of the parameter's range. The parameters that cause the most change in the profit over their range are then combined into scenarios that are used to find a design through a two stage mixed integer stochastic program. The first stage decisions are the capital investment decisions including the size and location of the processing plants. The second stage recourse decisions are the biomass and product flows in each scenario. The objective is the maximization of the expected profit over the different scenarios. The robustness and global sensitivity analysis of the nominal design (for a single nominal scenario) vs. the robust design (for multiple scenarios) are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation over the hypercube formed from the parameter ranges.},

  abstract = {Forest treatments have the potential to produce signiﬁcant quantities of forest residue biomass, which includes the tops and limbs from merchantable trees and smaller trees removed to meet management objectives. We spatially analyzed the sensitivity of ﬁnancially feasible biomass volumes for delivery to a bioenergy facility across 16 combinations of delivered biomass and diesel prices for a 515,900 ha area in western Montana. At the lowest delivered biomass price analyzed, \$31.52 per oven dried tonne (ODT), 28\% of the potential volume was ﬁnancially feasible at the lowest diesel price, \$0.053 LÀ1, dropping off to 6\% of the volume at the highest diesel price analyzed, \$1.32 LÀ1. With a 50\% increase in delivered biomass price to \$47.28 ODTÀ1, feasibility increased to 88\% at the \$0.53 LÀ1 diesel price, dropping to 36\% of the volume at the \$1.32 LÀ1 diesel price. Another 50\% increase in delivered biomass price to \$63.05 ODTÀ1 resulted in the feasible volume converging on the total potential volume at the lower diesel prices, and at the highest delivered price, \$78.81 ODTÀ1, nearly all potentially available biomass is ﬁnancially feasible even at the highest diesel fuel price analyzed. Haul was almost entirely restricted to paved roads closest to the bioenergy facility at the lowest delivered biomass price. As delivered price increased, feasible volume expanded further into areas accessed by unpaved roads as well as paved roads further from the bioenergy facility. Results show that ﬁnancial feasibility is much more sensitive to changes in delivered biomass prices than diesel prices.},

Fifteen studies that estimate availability of lignocellulosic biomass quantities in in the U.S. and/or Canada are reviewed. Sources of differences in study methods and assumptions and resulting biomass quantities are elucidated. We differentiate between inventory studies, in which quantities of biomass potentially available are estimated without rigorous consideration of the costs of supply, versus economic studies, which take into consideration various opportunity costs and competition. The U.S. economic studies, which included reasonably comprehensive sets of biomass categories, estimate annual biomass availability to range from 6 million to 577 million dry metric tonnes (dry t), depending on offered price, while estimates from inventory studies range from 190 million to 3849 million dry t. The Canadian inventory studies, which included reasonably comprehensive sets of biomass categories, estimate availability to range from 64 million green t to 561 million dry t. The largest biomass categories for the U.S. are energy crops and agricultural residues, while for Canada they are expected to be energy crops and logging residues. The significant differences in study estimates are due in large part to the number of biomass categories included, whether economic considerations are incorporated, assump-tions about energy crop yields and land areas, and level of optimism of assumptions of the study.},

Significant amounts of forest residues are potentially available within the study area: approximately 2.8 million dry tons in North Carolina, 1.8 million dry tons in South Carolina, and 1.3 million dry tons in Virginia. These quantities are sufficient to satisfy regional biomass electricity production requirements only through 2012 under a hypothetical national Renewable Portfolio Standard and Renewable Fuels Standard, after which changes in the biomass resource stream will be necessary. Supply curves generated for multiple regions in each state indicate that forest residues vary regionally in both supply and price, and exceeding the supply of forest residues could be accompanied by a dramatic spike in resource pricing, with implications for timberland owners and users of the forest resource base.},

Biomass is considered the renewable energy source with the highest potential to contribute to the energy needs of modern society for both the industrialized and developing countries worldwide. The most important biomass energy sources are wood and wood wastes, agricultural crops and their waste byproducts, municipal solid waste, animal wastes, waste from food processing, and aquatic plants and algae. Biomass is one potential source of renewable energy and the conversion of plant material into a suitable form of energy, usually electricity or as a fuel for an internal combustion engine, can be achieved using a number of different routes, each with specific pros and cons. Currently, much research has been focused on sustainable and environmental friendly energy from biomass to replace conventional fossil fuels. The main objective of the present study is to investigate global potential and use of biomass energy and its contribution to the sustainable energy development by presenting its historical development.},

Spatial dispersion of forest biomass results in significant transportation cost of bulky, forest biomass feedstock. Multiple studies document different approaches to address theissues associated with biofuel facility siting. Study objectives were to: examine current literature (work published since 2005) discussing methods and models to determine the optimal location or site for a forest biomass-to-biofuel facility; compare the methods to identify the preferred approach; and identify potential gaps for future research. Our evaluation summarizes major, recent studies that focused on mathematical models to optimally locate a forest biomass-to-biofuel facility. Through analysis of the various methods, including the advantages and disadvantages, this study uncovered preferred approaches for locating an optimal biofuel facility location. It was found that optimization using mixed integer programming appears to be the preferred method for optimally locating a biofuel site.},

The impacts on forestry and forest industries of the different energy price scenarios were also studied. The advantage of the suggested methodology is that it allows for assessments of the economic potential of bioenergy, taking into account the competition for raw materials, the specific heat demand of various regions, and interregional and international trade. Bioenergy will, according to this study, be fairly competitive in some market segments with the current price levels of electricity and oil, and only a minor increase (decrease) in energy (roundwood) prices would release substantially increased bioenergy production levels. Pulpwood prices of pine and non-coniferous species are projected to increase substantially when assuming increasing energy prices. Except for particleboard mills, production levels of forest industries appeared relatively insensitive to the energy price changes.},

  abstract = {Implementing small residue chippers on conventional feller-buncher, skidder, and knuckleboom loader logging operations was studied in 2006 and 2007. A thinning operation fed the chipper using the same loader that handled roundwood sorting and loading, while a clearcut operation used a separate loader with the chipper. Both operations used set-out trailers to improve transportation efficiency. Production was evaluated for 65 weeks on the thinning operation and 42 weeks on the clearcut operation. Costs for producing and delivering the biomass material were estimated using an after-tax cash-flow method. The thinning operation produced an average of 32 metric tonnes (35 American tons) of biomass per day (SD: 20 tonnes and 22 tons, respectively), at an estimated cost of \$18.38 per tonne delivered (\$16.71/ton). The clearcut operation averaged 50 tonnes (55 tons) of biomass per day (SD: 19 tonnes and 21 tons), at a cost of \$17.81/tonne (\$16.19/ton). The biomass produced contained about 75\% wood, with the remaining material consisting of bark, needles, and twigs. Implementing a residue chipper on a conventional operation can be economically feasible for producing biomass for an alternative fuels market, provided that it does not interfere with roundwood production. Set-out trucking aids the operation by minimizing the delay time for trucks.},

  abstract = {Research Highlights: A set of 128 potential bioenergy facility locations is established and evaluated based on the transport cost to select optimal locations. Background and Objectives: The identiﬁcation of optimal facility locations to process recovered forest biomass is an important decision in designing a bioenergy supply chain at the strategic planning level. The result of this analysis can aﬀect supply chain costs and the overall eﬃciency of the network, due to the low density and dispersed nature of forest biomass and the high costs associated with its logistics operations. In this study, we develop a two-stage decision support system to identify the optimal site locations for forest biomass conversion based on biomass availability, transport distance and cost. Materials and Methods: In the ﬁrst stage, a GIS-based analysis is designed to identify strategic locations of potential bioenergy sites. The second stage evaluates the most cost-eﬀective locations individually using a transportation cost model, based on the results from stage one. The sensitivity of inputs, such as maximum allowable transport cost, the distance of transport and their relations to the proﬁt balance, and changes in fuel price are tested. The method is applied to a real case study in the state of Queensland, Australia. Results and Conclusions: The GIS analysis resulted in 128 strategic candidate locations being suggested for bioenergy conversion sites. The logistics analysis estimated the optimal cost and transportation distance of each one of the locations and ranked them according to the overall performance between capacities of 5 and 100 MW.},

  abstract = {Biomass can be used for the production of fuels, and chemicals with reduced life cycle (greenhouse gas) emissions. Currently, these fuels and chemicals are produced mainly from natural gas and other fossil fuels. In Western Canada, forest residue biomass is gasiﬁed for the production of syngas which is further synthesized to produce different fuels and chemicals. Two types of gasiﬁers: the atmospheric pressure gasiﬁer (commercially known as SilvaGas) and the pressurized gasiﬁer (commercially known as RENUGAS) are considered for syngas production. The production costs of methanol, (dimethyl ether), (Fischer-Tropsch) fuels, and ammonia are \$0.29/kg, \$0.47/kg, \$0.97/kg, and \$2.09/kg, respectively, for a SilvaGas-based gasiﬁcation plant with a capacity of 2000 dry tonnes/day. The cost of producing methanol, DME, F-T fuels, and ammonia in a RENUGAS-based plant are \$0.45/kg, \$0.69/kg, \$1.53/kg, and \$2.72/kg, respectively, for a plant capacity of 2000 dry tonnes/day. The minimum cost of producing methanol, DME, F-T fuels, and ammonia are \$0.28/kg, \$0.44/kg, \$0.94/kg, and \$2.06/kg at plant capacities of 3000, 3500, 4000, and 3000 dry tonnes/day, respectively, using the SilvaGas-based gasiﬁcation process. Biomass-based fuels and chemicals are expensive compared to fuels and chemicals derived from fossil fuels, and carbon credits can help them become competitive.},

  abstract = {Forest harvest residues, which include limbs, branches, and tree tops, have the potential to generate energy. This paper uses a life-cycle assessment to determine the energy input-to-output ratios for each unit operation in the use of these residues for power generation. Two preparation options for obtaining the biomass were evaluated. For Option 1, the forest residues were chipped at the landing, while for Option 2 they were bundled and chipped at the power plant. Energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were found for power plants sizes ranging from 10 to 300 MW. For power plants with capacities greater than 30 MW, the transportation of either bundles or woodchips to the power plant used the most energy, especially at larger power plant sizes. Option 1 used less energy than Option 2 for all power plant sizes, with the difference between the two becoming smaller for larger power plants. For the life-cycle GHG emissions, Option 1 ranges from 14.71 to 19.51 g-CO2eq/kW h depending on the power plant size. Option 2 ranges from 21.42 to 20.90 g-CO2eq/kW h. The results are not linear and are close to equal at larger power plant sizes. The GHG emissions increase with increasing moisture content. For a 300 MW power plant with chipping at the landing, the GHG emissions range from 11.17 to 22.24 g-CO2eq/kW h for moisture contents from 15\% to 50\%. The sensitivity analysis showed both energy use and GHG emissions are most sensitive to moisture content and then plant lifetime. For the equipment, both the energy use and GHG emissions are most sensitive to changes in the fuel consumption and load capacity of the chip van and the log-haul truck used to transport either bundles or wood chips to the power plant.

  abstract = {Transporting biomass feedstock to biomass-based energy conversion facilities and optimally locating those facilities are among the main challenges in using biomass as a renewable source of energy. As part of the biomass collection procedure, agricultural residue is compacted into bales and amassed at biomass collection points (BCPs) for truck pick-up and delivery to conversion facilities. This study developed a framework for locating BCPs using an iterative process model in a geographic information systems (GIS) environment. The model used the biomass spatial distribution and road network maps and, via an iteration process, gave preference to zones with high biomass availability and short distance to the roads. The framework was applied to the particular case of optimally locating biomass-based conversion facilities in the Department of Santa Cruz in Bolivia, where there is a vast potential to use agricultural residues for energy production purposes. In total, 107 BCPs were located in the department with capacities ranging from 10,000 to 26,000 dry tonnes per collection point per year and an overall biomass collection capacity of 1.5 M dry tonnes per year. Exclusion, preference, suitability, and locationallocation analyses were then conducted using BCPs, facility candidate sites, and road network to locate seven optimal sites with capacities ranging from 23 to 83 MW which can be supplied by biomass ranging from 110,000 to 390,000 dry tonnes per year. The BCP framework developed here can improve the efficiency of collecting biomass and the accuracy of locating biomass-based facilities. Decision makers can use these results to expand biomass application in the energy sector in Bolivia.},

  abstract = {Logistics cost, the cost of moving feedstock or products, is a key component of the overall cost of recovering energy from biomass. In this study, we calculate for small- and large-project sizes, the relative cost of transportation by truck, rail, ship, and pipeline for three biomass feedstocks, by truck and pipeline for ethanol, and by transmission line for electrical power. Distance fixed costs (loading and unloading) and distance variable costs (transport, including power losses during transmission), are calculated for each biomass type and mode of transportation. Costs are normalized to a common basis of a giga Joules of biomass. The relative cost of moving products vs feedstock is an approximate measure of the incentive for location of biomass processing at the source of biomass, rather than at the point of ultimate consumption of produced energy. In general, the cost of transporting biomass is more than the cost of transporting its energy products. The gap in cost for transporting biomass vs power is significantly higher than the incremental cost of building and operating a power plant remote from a transmission grid. The cost of power transmission and ethanol transport by pipeline is highly dependent on scale of project. Transport of ethanol by truck has a lower cost than by pipeline up to capacities of 1800 t/d. The high cost of transshipment to a ship precludes shipping from being an economical mode of transport for distances less than 800 km (woodchips) and 1500 km (baled agricultural residues).},

The pelletization of biomass consists of a series of unit operations: drying, size reduction, densifying, cooling, screening, and warehousing. Capital and operating cost of the pelleting plant was estimated at several plant capacities. Pellet production cost for a base case plant capacity of 6 t/h was about \$51/t of pellets. Raw material cost was the largest cost element of the total pellet production cost followed by personnel cost, drying cost, and pelleting mill cost. An increase in raw material cost substantially increased the pellet production cost. Pellet plants with a capacity of more than 10 t/h decreased the costs to roughly \$40/t of pellets. Five different burner fuels – wet sawdust, dry sawdust, biomass pellets, natural gas, and coal were tested for their effect on the cost of pellet production. Wet sawdust and coal, the cheapest burner fuels, produced the lowest pellet production cost. The environmental impacts due to the potential emissions of these fuels during the combustion process require further investigation.},

  abstract   = {Increasing use of woody fuels requires that nontraditional types of raw materials are exploited, including logging residues and small-diameter trees. Although medium-scale combustors often use pellets, they could conceivably use dried chips of sufficiently narrow size distribution (henceforth pellet chips). The influence of the following factors on the relative cost-effectiveness of producing pellets and pellet chips was investigated for three plant sites in northern Sweden: (1) harvesting and transporting of forest residues; (2) the potential of existing energy plants to supply drying heat in periods of capacity surplus; (3) the distance to potential end-users. Data from the national forest inventory were used to estimate raw material costs. The resulting production costs were 144–176 \$ per oven-dry tonnes (OD t) for pellets (27.4–33.5 \$ MWh
              −1
              ) and 143–173 \$ OD t

              −1

              (21.7–23.2 \$ MWh
              −1
              ) for both fuels. Even though the differences in production costs were minor, the production of pellet chips requires significantly less electricity input per OD t of produced fuel. For cost reductions improved methods for wood fuel procurement, compacting and transporting of chips, small-scale low-temperature drying and foliage and bark separation are needed.},

  abstract   = {The substitution of conventional fossil fuels with biomass for energy production results both in a net reduction of greenhouse gases emissions and in the replacement of non-renewable energy sources. However, at present, generating energy from biomass is rather expensive due to both technological limits related to lower conversion efﬁciencies, and logistic constraints. In particular, the logistics of biomass fuel supply is likely to be complex owing to the intrinsic feedstock characteristics, such as the limited period of availability and the scattered geographical distribution over the territory. In this paper, the economical feasibility of biomass utilization for direct production of electric energy by means of combustion and gasiﬁcation-conversion processes, has been investigated and evaluated over a capacity range from 5 to 50 MW, taking into account total capital investments, revenues from energy sale and total operating costs, also including a detailed evaluation of logistic costs. Moreover, in order to evaluate the impact of logistics on the bioenergy plants proﬁtability, the effects of main logistic variables such as speciﬁc vehicle transport costs, vehicles capacity, speciﬁc purchased biomass costs and distribution density, have been examined. Finally, a mapping of logistic constraints on plant proﬁtability in the speciﬁed capacity range has been carried out.},

  abstract = {Rising prices and uncertain supplies of petroleum, together with environmental concerns regarding fossil fuel combustion, has enhanced interest in biobased products and fuels. The work reported here analyzes the feasibility of a multi-product biorefinery using wheat straw as feedstock that produces ethanol, electricity, and cellulose nanofibers. The nanofibers (nanowhiskers) would be used as reinforcements in a biobased nanocomposite material that could substitute for fiberglass in many applications. The analysis indicates that, at 2005 prices and costs, the biorefinery would be marginally profitable. Anticipated advances in bioprocessing technology would enhance profitability. The facility would also make a substantial contribution to the biorefinery site area economy, as a high percentage of operating expenses would be payments to local entities. The growth of a biobased industry could have major economic development implications for the Great Plains/Midwest region.},
